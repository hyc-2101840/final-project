## The Algorithm

It is trained to recognize normal eyes and eyes with cataracts. It does this by comparing the pixels in the images. To use it, you have to upload an image into it. When it gives out the answer in the form of another image, there will be a percentage and whatever it thinks the image is on the top left corner.
